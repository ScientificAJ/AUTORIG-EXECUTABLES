# Support

For technical support, partnership, or deployment questions:

- Email: `support@astroclub.space`

When contacting support, include:

- OS and architecture
- AutoRig artifact filename and version
- `source_commit` from `BUILD_INFO.json` (this ties the binary back to the source repo)
- Exact command used
- Whether EXPERIMENTAL geometric inference mode was enabled (`AUTORIG_ENABLE_GEOMETRIC_AUTORIG`)
- If using the drawing UI: browser name/version and any console errors
- Full terminal error output

Notes:

- EXPERIMENTAL features are best-effort and may change without notice. When disabled (default), behavior matches the standard ML mode.
